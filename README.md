# ReportCompiler
A tool for importing vulnerability scanner data and then allowing you to manipulate the risks, affected hosts, and create risk ordered output.

This represents the "Binary" release. For those who just want to use it. If you want to contribute or just to see the source then go to this repository:

https://github.com/cornerpirate/ReportCompilerSource

The seperation was to make the binary (user) land as small as possible. There are a lot of libraries making the distribution large.

I update this monthly with the latest list of CVE vulnerabilities as gathered in "CVE-OFFLINE" which is available here:

## Overview

You can use this to work with the output from various Security scanning tools. An overview of it is shown at the blog page below:

That explains what it imports, what it outputs, and a high-level of the features.

## Making it work with a word report

I also explained how to use the output from ReportCompiler at this blog post:

By reviewing the above you will be able to get output from RC into a word document.

Happy reporting.

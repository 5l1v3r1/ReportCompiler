# ReportCompiler
A tool for importing vulnerability scanner data and then allowing you to manipulate the risks, affected hosts, and create risk ordered output.

## Overview

You can use this to work with the output from various Security scanning tools. An overview of it is shown at the blog page below:

That explains what it imports, what it outputs, and a high-level of the features.

## Making it work with a word report

I also explained how to use the output from ReportCompiler at this blog post:

By reviewing the above you will be able to get output from RC into a word document.

Happy reporting.
